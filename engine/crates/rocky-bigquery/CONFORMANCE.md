# BigQuery adapter conformance

This document maps the conformance categories defined in
`rocky-adapter-sdk::conformance::test_specs` to the live smoke drivers
that exercise the BigQuery adapter end-to-end against a real GCP
project. It's the receipt for "we exercised the surface" — the
runtime version of the suite (`rocky test-adapter`) is currently a
stub (per the docstring on `run_conformance`: "this returns a plan
with all tests marked as skipped or with placeholder timing"); the
live smoke drivers under
`examples/playground/pocs/07-adapters/05-bigquery-native-queries/live/`
are what actually exercise the adapter.

## Coverage matrix

| Category | Test | Status | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connection | `connect` | ✅ live | every smoke driver authenticates and runs at least one query |
| DDL | `create_table` | ✅ live | `live/run.sh` (full-refresh CTAS), `live/merge/run.sh` (bootstrap) |
| DDL | `drop_table` | ✅ live | `live/drift/run.sh` stage 3 (`drop_and_recreate` action) |
| DDL | `create_catalog` | ⚪ N/A | `BigQueryDialect::create_catalog_sql` returns `None`; BQ projects can't be created via SQL. Documented in adapter source. |
| DDL | `create_schema` | ✅ live | exercised inside `live/<strategy>/run.sh` cleanup (`bq rm -r -f -d`) and via `auto_create_schemas` on the replication path |
| DML | `insert_into` | ✅ live | `live/drift/run.sh` (incremental replication) |
| DML | `merge_into` | ✅ live | `live/merge/run.sh` (bootstrap + UPSERT) |
| Query | `describe_table` | ✅ live | `live/drift/run.sh` (existence probe + drift detection); covered by `BigQueryAdapter::describe_table` integration test |
| Query | `table_exists_true` / `table_exists_false` | ✅ live | `live/merge/run.sh` first-run bootstrap probes target absence; subsequent run probes target presence |
| Query | `execute_query` | ✅ live | every smoke driver round-trips at least one `SELECT` |
| Types | `type_string`, `type_integer`, `type_float`, `type_boolean`, `type_date`, `type_timestamp`, `type_null` | 🟡 implicit | not exercised by a dedicated type-coverage driver. The shipped smokes use STRING (`name`), INT64 (`id`, `score`), TIMESTAMP (`_updated_at`), NUMERIC (`score` after widening). FLOAT64, BOOL, DATE, and explicit NULL are not live-exercised yet. |
| Dialect | `format_table_ref` | ✅ unit + live | unit tests in `dialect.rs::tests` plus implicit coverage in every smoke (every query references three-part names) |
| Dialect | `watermark_where` | ✅ unit | unit-tested in `dialect.rs`. Not exercised by a live transformation pipeline today (the transformation incremental path is undertested workspace-wide; see `feedback_helpers_without_call_sites.md`). |
| Dialect | `row_hash` | ⚪ not implemented | the trait method isn't on `SqlDialect` today; no adapter implements it. Conformance test references a future trait surface. |
| Governance | `set_tags` | ⚪ no-op by design | `BigQueryGovernanceAdapter::set_tags` warns + returns `Ok(())`. BQ tag application requires the IAM Resource Manager API, not SQL — outside the warehouse-adapter trait surface. Documented in `governance.rs:175-189`. |
| Governance | `get_grants` | ⚪ no-op by design | same as `set_tags` — IAM grants are REST-only, not SQL-issuable. |
| BatchChecks | `batch_row_counts` / `batch_freshness` | 🟡 unit-tested | `BigQueryBatchCheckAdapter` is exercised by unit tests + the discover-path's `--with-schemas` warm-up code path. Not exercised in any current smoke driver. Adding `--with-schemas` to `live/discover/run.sh` would close this gap. |
| Discovery | `discover` | ✅ live | `live/discover/run.sh` |

Legend: ✅ exercised live · 🟡 implicit / partial · ⚪ N/A or by design

## Open findings (documented limitations)

These are known limitations carried forward in the adapter today.
Each is documented either in the adapter source or
`live/README.md`; none break the workflow when the caller is aware:

1. **Model-sidecar TOMLs skip env-var substitution.** Engine-wide gap (not BQ-specific). Workaround: hardcode catalog in model TOML.
2. **`auto_create_schemas` unwired in transformation run path.** Engine-wide gap (not BQ-specific). Workaround: pre-create the dataset via `bq mk`.
3. **Time-interval `time_column` must be TIMESTAMP on BigQuery.** The runtime emits the partition filter as `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` literals; BQ refuses to coerce to a DATE column. `sql_gen.rs:239`. Workaround: model SQL uses `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(...)`.
4. **MERGE requires explicit `update_columns` on BigQuery.** BQ rejects `UPDATE SET target = source` shorthand. Workaround: declare `update_columns` in the model TOML.
5. **`bytes_scanned` is `totalBytesProcessed` for queries that return zero rows-billed.** BQ exempts constant queries (e.g., the full-refresh smoke's no-source UNNEST literal) from the 10 MB minimum-bill floor. Real source-scanning models populate non-zero values via the `jobs.get` enrichment path (PR #330).

## Recommendation: ready to drop `is_experimental`

`BigQueryAdapter::is_experimental()` returns `true` today, which fires
two warnings on every adapter construction:

- `BigQueryAdapter::new` logs `"BigQuery adapter is experimental..."`
- The CLI registry emits a separate `"adapter '<name>' is
  experimental — some features may be incomplete..."`

The adapter has been live-verified across every dialect surface
that has a live smoke driver. The remaining gaps are documented
limitations (above) — most engine-wide, none breaking the workflows
they cover when the user is aware.

The gate per the trial-window plan was: "Conformance suite green or
every red has a documented exemption." Given the conformance suite
itself is a stub, the equivalent gate is: "Live smokes green or every
gap is documented in this file." That gate is met today.

**Flipping the flag is a one-line change in `src/connector.rs`** plus
removing the warning. **Not done in this PR — it's a credibility
statement to users and should land with explicit go-ahead.**
